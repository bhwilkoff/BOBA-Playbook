# Autonomous Iteration Loop — Progress Log

**Started:** 2026-05-20 (post-sealed-products commit)
**Owner instruction:** *"Create a persistent loop (surviving compacting) to iterate on (1) cross-platform parity across iOS / web / Android and (2) all documented deferred features. Use agents, project docs, and platform-specific Claude skills. Significant + well-documented progress over a few hours."*

This document is the persistent state — every loop tick reads + updates it. Each tick: pick the highest-priority item, implement, verify, commit + push, update this doc.

---

## Working philosophy

- **Native-first only.** Reach for built-in platform APIs before custom anything (`feedback_native_first`).
- **Bound each tick.** Pick work that can ship in ~20-40 minutes. If something balloons, split it.
- **Verify before claiming.** `xcodebuild` on iOS, `gradlew assembleDebug` on Android, smoke test in browser for web. Don't mark "done" on intent alone.
- **Commit every shipped tick.** Push to main. Ben sees progress incrementally.
- **Pull from documented sources.** PARITY.md, DECISIONS.md, SCRATCHPAD.md, DESIGN.md, WEB-DESIGN.md, ANDROID-DESIGN.md, ARCHIVE.md, COWORK.md. Discord-export JSONs from research dirs when relevant.

## Backlog (priority-ordered)

Order = (impact × shipping cost⁻¹). Higher impact + cheaper to ship = sooner.

### P0 — Quick wins from beta feedback / verified bugs

- [ ] **Verify sealed-image fix on web + Android** — iOS render path uses `card.isSealed` via CDN.swift; web js/api.js and Android core/network/CDN.kt should do the same. Spot-check that the catalog bake from v2.288 actually lights up in all three.
- [ ] **9 sealed products still missing R2 art** — surface them in `assets/data/missing-sealed.json` so the next sourcing pass picks them up.

### P1 — Cross-platform parity (pulled from PARITY.md)

Documented gaps where iOS has shipped but web / Android hasn't, OR vice versa.

- [ ] **Web Wall view + Price overlay** — `PARITY.md` line 142: iOS ✅, web ⏳ M-future. Already on the §15 roadmap.
- [ ] **Web Value history chart** — `PARITY.md` line 130: iOS ✅, web 🔮.
- [ ] **Web Custom Rainbows** — `PARITY.md` line 137: iOS ✅, web 🔮.
- [ ] **Android Custom Rainbows full parity** — currently `⏳ M2`, started but not complete.
- [ ] **Web sign-in with Google** — currently 🔮 on both iOS + web; Android shipped.
- [ ] **Android Whatnot tile list** — currently shows section header but no Worker wiring (per SCRATCHPAD).
- [ ] **Android Google Maps Find a Store** — needs Maps API key + Compose Maps wiring.

### P1 — Android v1 deferred polish (per SCRATCHPAD Android section)

- [ ] **Material 3 Expressive APIs** — FAB Menu / Floating Toolbar / Wavy Indicators (needs compileSdk 37 — currently 36).
- [ ] **M3 SearchBar full-screen morph** — Find tab uses OutlinedTextField for now; should use `ExpandedFullScreenSearchBar`.
- [ ] **Container transform / sharedBounds animations** — hero-zoom into card detail.
- [ ] **Article corpus port from iOS Swift** — Learn content depth gap.
- [ ] **Image fingerprinting (MediaPipe)** — defer per DECISIONS.md #043 (v1 = OCR-only).
- [ ] **Discord OAuth via Custom Tabs** — currently stubbed; Google works.

### P1 — iPad polish (SCRATCHPAD "Deferred iPad work")

- [ ] **Walkthrough anchor verification on iPad** — needs simulator validation.
- [ ] **iPad drag-and-drop between deck slots** — significant; nice-to-have.
- [ ] **Scan view landscape polish** — fixed guide size feels small on iPad.

### P2 — Web "feels native" follow-ups (per WEB-DESIGN.md §15 deferred)

- [ ] **Walkthroughs on web** — explicitly out of scope per §11.
- [ ] **Cmd-K command palette** — out of scope per §2.4.
- [ ] **Web push notifications** — out of scope per §17.

### P2 — Deferred from project docs

- [ ] **Match-alerts pipeline** (DECISIONS.md #039 + TRADE-DESIGN.md Phase 5) — APNs / FCM dispatcher. Multi-week of new infra.
- [ ] **Hero Shot 3D R2 `/full/` resolution upgrade** (SCRATCHPAD blockers) — Hero Shot pixelation root cause.
- [ ] **Practice executor on Android** (DECISIONS.md #048) — admin-gated. M5.5 milestone.
- [ ] **Personal Showcase on Android + web** (Cast SDK) — iOS-only today.

### Audit-driven items (populated by background agents)

*[Updated as agent results land — currently pending]*

## Tick log

Each loop tick appends an entry below. Format:

```
### Tick N — 2026-05-20 HH:MM MT
- **Picked:** {backlog item title}
- **Shipped:** {commit short SHA + version bump}
- **Verified:** {build status + smoke test method}
- **Next:** {what's next in queue}
```

### Tick 0 — 2026-05-20 — setup
- **Picked:** establish the loop infrastructure
- **Shipped:** this doc + 3 background audit agents launched
- **Verified:** n/a (setup)
- **Next:** ship one P0 item while audits run

### Tick 1 — 2026-05-20 — missing-sealed manifest
- **Picked:** P0 backlog item "9 sealed products still missing R2 art"
- **Shipped:** `assets/data/missing-sealed.json` with the 9 sealed-product rows
  needing art. Each carries bobaId / sealedProductId / set / cardNumber /
  radishUrl + expected R2 path. Once new files land on
  `r2:boba-card-images/sealed/optimized/` and `/sealed/thumbs/`, a re-run
  of `scripts/apply_sealed_images.py` lights them up automatically.
- **Verified:** read back the JSON — 9 entries, matches the script's
  9-still-missing count from v2.288.
- **Next:** wait for audit agents (A, B, C), then start cross-platform
  parity shipping in tick 2.

## Audit agents in flight

When each agent returns, its findings populate the backlog above.

- **Agent A (parity audit):** scans iOS vs web vs Android for shipped-but-not-mirrored features beyond what PARITY.md captures
- **Agent B (deferred-feature inventory):** sweeps every `.md` doc + DECISIONS.md entries + SCRATCHPAD `Deferred` sections + commits-with-"defer" / "TODO" / "follow-up" markers
- **Agent C (Discord export JSON inventory):** locates the Claude research dir + parses Discord export JSONs for user-requested features

Status of each: queued / running / complete + findings folded back into Backlog.
