# BOBA Playbook — Architecture & Technology Decisions

Entries capture the *why* behind choices — not just what we decided but what principle it encodes. Technical details that anyone can read from the code don't belong here. The question every entry should answer: *what would the next developer get wrong if they didn't know this?*

---

## 001 — Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS for Web
*2026-04-03*
No framework, no build step. GitHub Pages serves static files directly. Framework abstractions cost more than they save at this scale; adding one now would require a build pipeline, a CI step, and a mental model that every future contributor has to carry.

**Principle**: Reach for complexity only when simplicity has actually failed, not when it might someday fail.

## 002 — Xcode Project at Repository Root
*2026-04-03*
`.xcodeproj` lives at repo root, no subdirectory, no spaces in project name. Required for Xcode Cloud auto-discovery. Lesson from Bsky Dreams: a nested path caused a persistent "Project does not exist at root" error that cost hours to diagnose.

## 003 — Shared Version Config (xcconfig)
*2026-04-03*
`AppVersion.xcconfig` defines `MARKETING_VERSION` and `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION`. Editing via Xcode's identity panel creates per-target overrides that drift silently. Always edit the xcconfig file directly.

## 004 — SwiftUI + @Observable + SwiftData (iOS)
*2026-04-03*
SwiftUI for all UI. `@Observable` (iOS 17 macro) for state. SwiftData for local persistence. UIKit only where SwiftUI lacks a native equivalent. Requires iOS 17+ minimum deployment target.

## 005 — Dual-Platform Feature Parity Model
*2026-04-03*
Both platforms implement the same core feature set. Platform-specific implementation is acceptable; platform-exclusive features are the exception, not the rule. Track parity in SCRATCHPAD.md. Every feature is effectively built twice — mitigated by shared API contracts and design tokens.

## 006 — App Name and Brand Identity
*2026-04-03*
Display name: BOBA Playbook. Xcode product: BOBAPlaybook (no hyphens). Design language: Retro-futurism + cyberpunk + glassmorphism. Palette: battle orange (#FF4D00), cyber cyan (#00F5FF), deep violet (#8B00FF) on near-black (#080810). Card art is always the focal point — UI chrome frames it, never competes.

## 007 — Supabase for Auth and User Data Only
*2026-04-03*
Supabase handles auth, `user_cards`, `decks`, `deck_cards`. Card catalog browsing uses static JSON — no DB query needed. **Supabase Storage is NOT used** — the free tier would exhaust quickly for a card image app.

## 008 — Cloudflare R2 for Image CDN
*2026-04-03*
Card images live on R2 (`boba-card-images`). Zero egress fees and Cloudflare edge caching. Two tiers: `thumbs/` (200px WebP, ~10KB) for grids; `full/` (≤1200px WebP, ~80KB) for detail views. **Never hardcode R2 URLs** — always use CDN helpers in `CDN.swift` / `js/api.js`.

## 009 — Static Card Catalog JSON
*2026-04-03*
`cards.json` (17,739 cards) committed to `assets/data/` and served from GitHub Pages. No database for catalog browsing. To update for new sets: re-run `reconcile_all.py`, copy outputs to `assets/data/`, commit.

## 010 — Element Color System
*2026-04-03*
Each element maps to a canonical UI color: FIRE #FF4D00, ICE #00BFFF, HEX #8B00FF, STEEL #8A9BB0, BRAWL #C0392B, GLOW #FFD700, GUM #FF69B4, SUPER #FF00FF, NONE #666680. Elements in cards.json are always UPPERCASE.

## 011 — No Card Images in Git
*2026-04-03*
Card images live exclusively on Cloudflare R2. `assets/data/` contains only JSON. Keeps clone fast and avoids GitHub's soft 1 GB storage limit.

## 012 — Scan Mode: On-Device Vision Only
*2026-04-03*
Card identification uses iOS Vision (`VNRecognizeTextRequest`) and AVFoundation only. No image is uploaded. Pipeline: OCR frame → card number regex `#?([A-Z]{1,6}-[A-Z]?\d{1,4}(?:[/-]\d{1,4})?)` → match display-cards.json. Falls back to manual search.

**Principle**: User data stays on user devices. On-device processing is not a technical constraint here — it's the right choice for the user.

## 013 — Pricing Comps Strategy
*2026-04-03*
Pricing fetched live at card-detail view time via Cloudflare Worker (eBay Browse API + Radish Price Guide in parallel). Prices not stored in Supabase — live lookups only. Collection value dashboard caches last-fetched price in `user_cards.estimated_value`.

Worker URL: `boba-ebay-proxy.benwilkoff.workers.dev` — stored in `BOBAPlaybook/Config.swift` and `js/app.js`.

## 014 — iOS Card Catalog: Two-Phase Progressive Loading
*2026-04-03*
Phase 1: synchronous decode of `cards-head.json` (500 cards, ~192KB) in `CardStore.init()` — cards are available before SwiftUI frame 1 (<50ms). Phase 2: `Task.detached(priority: .background)` decodes `display-cards.json` (~12k cards, 4.7MB).

**Principle**: The user should never wait on data we already have. Phase 1 costs nothing and eliminates a blank screen.

## 015 — imageAvailable Flag Bypass
*2026-04-03*
`imageAvailable` boolean is NOT used to gate image loading. Any card with a non-empty `imageFile` always attempts CDN load. The flag had false negatives — some cards had `imageAvailable: false` but valid CDN images.

## 016 — Section Named "Play" Not "Rules"
*2026-04-03*
The rules/strategy/deck-builder section is named **Play** on both platforms. "Rules" implies constraint; "Play" conveys purpose.

**Principle**: Language shapes how users feel about a feature before they open it.

## 017 — Web Filter Panel: Mobile Collapsible, Desktop Persistent
*2026-04-03*
Mobile (<768px): filter panel hidden by default, toggled by a button with an active-count badge. Desktop (≥768px): always visible. Mirrors the iOS bottom sheet pattern.

## 018 — PWA GitHub Pages 404 Handling
*2026-04-03*
`404.html` redirects unresolvable URLs back to `/`, preserving query string. `manifest.json` has `"scope": "/"`. Without this, PWA homescreen launches hit GitHub's own 404 page.

## 019 — App Icon: XOXO Playbook Mark
*2026-04-03*
XOXO pattern (X, O, O, X in 2×2 grid) in BOBA orange on near-black. Legible at small sizes, evokes strategy/playbook thinking (X's and O's = play diagrams).

## 020 — Web Layout: Body Flex Column, No viewport-fit=cover
*2026-04-04*
`body { height: 100dvh; display: flex; flex-direction: column; overflow: hidden }` with `main { flex: 1; overflow-y: auto; min-height: 0 }`. The body does not scroll — content scrolls inside `main`.

**Why**: `position: fixed` headers land in a separate GPU compositor layer that Safari browser-mode misorders during address-bar transitions, causing content to bleed into the Dynamic Island. Body flex-column keeps the header in document flow. Reference: `github.com/bhwilkoff/Bsky-Dreams`.

**Consequences**: No `viewport-fit=cover`, no `env(safe-area-inset-top)`. IntersectionObserver must use `root: document.getElementById('main-content')`.

## 021 — Play Mode: Static Reference Content, Supabase for User Decks
*2026-04-05*
Rules, strategy guides, archetype templates, and the collecting guide are static/local — no auth required. User-created decks save to Supabase `decks` + `deck_cards` and require sign-in.

**Why**: Reference content belongs to everyone, immediately, without friction. Personal decks have identity — your choices, your strategy — and should persist across devices like the collection does. These are meaningfully different things.

## 022 — SwiftUI ScrollView Width: VStack Parent Must Have frame(maxWidth: .infinity)
*2026-04-06*
Any `VStack` that directly parents a `ScrollView` AND switches content conditionally must have `.frame(maxWidth: .infinity)`, or the ScrollView receives variable proposed widths per mode, causing horizontal rubber banding.

**Root cause**: SwiftUI's VStack sizes to the max of its children's natural widths. When that width varies by mode (e.g., Rookie = 228pt, Substitution = 361pt), every child ScrollView inherits that instability. Apply the frame constraint at the outermost VStack first.

## 023 — Mod Accounts: Role-Based Access via user_profiles
*2026-04-07*
Moderator roles live in a `user_profiles` Supabase table (`role`: user | moderator | admin). Role is never stored client-side permanently — fetched post-auth and cached in-memory for the session.

Card corrections → `card_corrections` table. Image overrides → `card_image_overrides`. Both require mod/admin role enforced by RLS. The catalog is static JSON, so corrections decouple user-submitted fixes from the release cycle.

## 024 — iOS Image Loading: Show Thumb Immediately While Full Loads
*2026-04-13*
When opening a card detail view, `CardImageView` checks NSCache for the thumb URL before showing a spinner. If the thumb is in cache (it almost always is — the user just saw it in the grid), it displays immediately. The full-res image loads in the background and replaces it when ready.

**Why**: A spinner for something the user just tapped creates a gap between intention and response. Showing the card immediately — even at grid resolution — confirms that the tap was registered and the right card is loading. Immediacy builds trust; spinners create anxiety.

## 025 — Feature Gating: Keep Code, Hide UI Entry Point
*2026-04-13*
When a feature is built but blocked on external dependencies (e.g., Discord trade room waiting on bot setup, eBay Market Feed waiting on API scope approval), we keep all implementation code in place and gate at the single UI entry point. We do not delete or hollow out working code while waiting.

**Why**: Building ahead of infrastructure is sometimes unavoidable. Half-deleting code creates a worse problem — the feature is harder to re-enable and the codebase is in an ambiguous state. A single `if featureEnabled { ... }` flag at the call site is the right level of intervention. When the dependency arrives, re-enabling should be one-line.

**Applied to**: Discord FAB in `CollectionView.swift` (commented call site, full implementation intact). Web Discord `fab.hidden = true` in the render loop.
